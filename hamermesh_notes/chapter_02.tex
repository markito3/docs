\chapter{Symmetry Groups}

{\bf Comments on ``If any two of these elements belong to the symmetry group, then so does the third.''} The statement can apply to other symmetry groups other than $S_2$. It depends on $C_2$ and $\sigma_h$ commuting, which they do as noted on p.\ 36. As an example of getting to one statement to the other, starting from $I = C_2\sigma_h$ applying $\sigma_h$ on the right gives $I\sigma_h = C_2$.
