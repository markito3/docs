\chapter{Symmetry Groups}

{\bf Comments on ``If any two of these elements belong to the symmetry
  group, then so does the third.''} (p.\ 37) Eqs.\ (2.6) and (2.6a)
show that each of the elements can be expressed as a combination of
the other two. Also all three commute with one another. So if two are
in the group, so must the third.
