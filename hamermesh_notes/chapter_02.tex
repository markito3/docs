\chapter{Symmetry Groups}

{\bf Comments on ``If any two of these elements belong to the symmetry
  group, then so does the third.''} (p.\ 37) Eqs.\ (2.6) and (2.6a)
show that each of the elements can be expressed as a combination of
the other two. Also all three commute with one another. So if two are
in the group, so must the third.


{\bf ...if the $X$- and $Y$-axes are 2-fold rotation axes, then so it
  the $Z$-axis.} (p.\ 38) Not known what this means.

$n$-fold rotation axis means that the object is symmetric under
rotation by $2\pi/n$ about that axis (defined on p.\ 33).
