\def\bx{\mathbf x}
\def\by{\mathbf y}

We consider a set of objects ${\mathbf x,y,...}$ in which the elements
can be ``multiplied'' by a complex number $\alpha$ or ``added'' to one
another to give members of the same set. Such a set is called a {\it
  linear vector space} $L$:

If $\bx$ and $\by$ are in $L$, then
$$
\alpha{\mathbf x} \quad {\rm and} \quad {\bx+\by = \by+\bx}
$$ are also in $L$. The ``multiplication'' and ``addition'' must
satisfy the conditions:
$$(\alpha + \beta)\bx = \alpha\bx + \beta\bx,$$
$$(\alpha\beta)\bx = \alpha(\beta\bx),$$
$$1\bx = \bx,$$
$$\alpha(\bx+\by) = \alpha\bx + \alpha\by.$$
The space $L$ will contain a zero vector (null vector), {\bf 0}, such that
$$\mathbf x + 0 = x \quad {\rm for all} \quad x.$$
Thus the linear vector space $L$ forms an abelian group under the
``addition'' operation, and its elements can be multiplied by complex numbers.
