\section{Correspondences and transformations.}

{\bf p.\ 3}: A restatement with a cyclic permutation:
$$
\genfrac(){0pt}0{1234}{2341}
$$
means that the object in box 1 goes to box 2, the object in box 2 goes
to box 3, {\it etc}. The numbers refer to the boxes and not the
objects. In this notation the order of the columns is irrelevant,
i.e.,
$$
\genfrac(){0pt}0{1324}{2431}
$$
is the same permutation.  If the objects were identified as A, B, C,
and D and start out in boxes 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively,
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 1234}{\tt ABCD}
$$
after application of the permutaion the box/object arrangement ends up as
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 1234}{\tt DABC}
$$

\section{Groups. Definitions and examples.}

By a group of tranformations, $G$, we mean an aggregate of
transformations of a given point set which
\begin{enumerate}
\item contains the identity transformation;
\item for every transformation $M$, also contains its inverse $M^{-1}$;
\item if it includes $M$ and $M^\prime$, also includes ther composite $MM^\prime$.
\end{enumerate}

[Rather than transformation, could use elements. Rather than
  composite, could use result of the group operation.]

{\bf p.\  7, Order of a Group}. The number of elements in a group is called the {\it order} of the group.

p.\ 11: The four group (a.k.a $V$) is

\begin{verbatim}
  eabc
  aecb
  bcea
  cbae
\end{verbatim}
with the properties that $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e$, $ab = c$,  $ac = b$,  and $bc = a$. 

{\bf p.\ 12}: (13)(12) should be intepreted as a transformation where
first (12) is applied followed by (13). An example:
$$
\genfrac(){0pt}0{123}{231}
$$
is a cyclic permutation. If we start with box/objects
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt ABC}
$$
then application of this permutation gives
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt CAB}
$$
which is equivalant to applying the transposition (13), which gives
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt CBA},
$$
followed by (23), which gives
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt CAB},
$$
and is also equivalant to applying the transposition (12), which gives
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt BAC},
$$
followed by (13), which gives
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt CAB}.
$$
This is not the same as (13) followed by (12), which gives
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123}{\tt BCA}.
$$

A nice page with examples of cycles:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/319979/how-to-write-permutations-as-product-of-disjoint-cycles-and-transpositions
.

{\bf p.\ 14}: Call (a...xb...y) ``the cycle.'' Ignoring other possible
independent cycles, we start with
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123456}{\tt ABCDEF}\quad,
$$
thus assuming $a=1$, $x=3$, $b=4$, and $y=6$. Applying the cycle we get
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123456}{\tt FABCDE}\quad.
$$
Now apply (ab), aka (14). We get
$$
\genfrac{}{}{0pt}0{\tt 123456}{\tt CABFDE}\quad.
$$
so this looks like (123)(456).

More generally, the cycle moves all objects to the next box, and in
particular the object in box $x$ moves to box $b$ and the object in
box $y$ moves to box $a$. So subsequent application of (ab) puts the
object that started in box $x$ into box $a$ and the object that
started in box $y$ into box $b$. The net effect is that objects in
boxes $a,...,x$ cycle among themselves. Likewise for the ojbect in
boxes $b,...,y$. I.e.,
$$
(ab)(a...xb...y) = (a...x)(b...y).
$$

\section{Subgroups. Cayley's theorem}

A subgroup is a subset of elements of a group that is a group
itself. Two trivial subgroups: the identity element and the entire
group. These are improper subgroups, as opposed to proper subgroups.

The subgroup must use same group operation as the group.

p. 15: An improper subgroup is the either the identity element alone or the whole group. Other subgroups are proper.

p. 15: Since the product of any pair of elements of $\mathcal H$ are
in $\mathcal H$ and each element of $\mathcal H$ contains its inverse,
for any element $a$ in $\mathcal H$, $aa^{-1} = e$ says that $e$ is an
element of $\mathcal H$.

p. 16: Notes on Cayley's Theorem: The symmetric group of degree $n$
has order $n!$. Cayley's Theorem refers to groups of order $n$ being
subgroups of the symmetric group of degree $n$ (not order $n$).

p.\ 17: Stated in the text: $ba_i = ba_j$ means $a_i = a_j$. The
result of both sides in the premise must be members of the group. The
statement is that they cannot result in the same member if $a_i$ and
$a_j$ are distinct members of the group. QUESTION: why? ANSWER: If
$ba_i = ba_j$ then $b^{-1}ba_i = b^{-1}ba_j$. Then $ea_i = ea_j$ and
so $a_i = a_j$. CONVOLUTED ANSWER:
\href{https://planetmath.org/uniquenessofinverseforgroups}{Inverses
  are unique}. Assume that $ba_i = ba_j$ and $a_i \neq a_j$. Then
$a^{-1}_i b^{-1} = a^{-1}_j b^{-1}$, and $a^{-1}_i b^{-1} b = a^{-1}_j
b^{-1} b$. So $a^{-1}_i = a^{-1}_j$ and since inverses are unique $a_i
= a_j$ which contradicts the assumption. So if $a_i \neq a_j$ then
$ba_i \neq ba_j$.

p. 19: A regular permutation is one for which no elements remain in
their original order. No definition of a regular subgroup is given. My
take: a regular subgroup is one where all elements are regular
permutations excluding the identity.

p. 19: Alternate statement of a property of certain
subgroups:\hfil\break Groups with only regular permutations (other
than the identity) have the following property. For any given box,
and for a given element (i.e., permutation) of the group, the image
box under the permutation is distinct from that of all other elements
of the group.

p. 20: Group $G$ is {\it cyclic} if there exists $a$, a member of $G$,
such that the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$ ($a,a^2,a^3,...$),
equals all of $g$

p.21: With reference to a proper subgroup $H$ of order $m$, of a
finite group $G$ of order $n$, where $n/m = h$, $h$ is called the
index of the subgroup. The set of members of the $G$ formed by
multiplying by $a$ on the left of each memeber of $H$, where $a$ is a
member of $G$ and not a member of $H$, is called a left coset of
$H$. Multiplying on the right gives a right coset. Note that cosets
cannot be subgroups of $G$ since they do not contain the identity.

\section{1.4 Cosets. Lagrange's theorem.}

{\bf Lagrange's Theorem}. The order of a subgroup of a finite group is
a divisor of the order of the group.

\section{Invariant subgroups. Factor group. Homomorphism}

Starting from a subgroup $\mathcal H$ of group $G$ and any member of
the group $a$, the set of elements $aha^{-1}$, where $h$ runs over all
members of the subgroup $\mathcal H$, is a subgroup itself and is
called the conjugate subgroup of $\mathcal H$ in $G$. If for all $a$,
$a{\mathcal H} a^{-1}$ = $\mathcal H$, we say that $\mathcal H$ is an
invariant subgroup in $G$.

...isomorphism for group...a one-to-one correspondences was set up
between elements $a$ of group $G$ and elements $a^\prime$ in a group
$G^\prime$, such that $(ab)^\prime = a^\prime b^\prime$. By a
homomorphic mapping of $G$ on $G^\prime$ we mean a similar
correspondence which preserves prducts, but now several elements of
$G$ may have the same image in $G^\prime$. [Example: cyclic group of
  order four mapped into cyclic group of order 2.]

\section{Direct Products}

A group $G$ is said to be a direct product of its subgroups ${\mathcal H_{\rm 1},...,H_{\rm n}}$ if:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The elements of different subgroups commute.
\item Every element of G is expressible in one and only one way as
  $g = h_1...h_n$, where $h_i$ is in ${\mathcal H}_i$, for $i = 1,...,n$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Linear vector spaces}

\def\bx{\mathbf x}
\def\by{\mathbf y}

We consider a set of objects ${\mathbf x,y,...}$ in which the elements
can be ``multiplied'' by a complex number $\alpha$ or ``added'' to one
another to give members of the same set. Such a set is called a {\it
  linear vector space} $L$:

If $\bx$ and $\by$ are in $L$, then
$$
\alpha{\mathbf x} \quad {\rm and} \quad {\bx+\by = \by+\bx}
$$
are also in $L$. The ``multiplication'' and ``addition'' must satisfy the conditions:
$$(\alpha + \beta)\bx = \alpha\bx + \beta\bx,$$
$$(\alpha\beta)\bx = \alpha(\beta\bx),$$
$$1\bx = \bx,$$
$$\alpha(\bx+\by) = \alpha\bx + \alpha\by.$$
The space $L$ will contain a zero vector (null vector), {\bf 0}, such that
$$\mathbf x + 0 = x \quad {\rm for all} \quad x.$$
Thus the linear vector space $L$ forms an abelian group under the
``addition'' operation, and its elements can be multiplied by complex numbers.
