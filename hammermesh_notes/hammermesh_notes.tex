\subsection{1-3 Subgroups. Cayley's theorem}

A subgroup is a subset of elements of a group that is a group itself. Two trivial subgroups: the indentity element and the entire group. These are improper subgroups, as opposed to proper subgroups.

The subgroup must use same group operation as the group.

\subsection{1-7 Direct Products}

A group $G$ is said to be a direct product of its subgroups ${\mathcal H_{\rm 1},...,H_{\rm n}}$ if:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The elements of different subgroups commute.
\item Every element of G is expressible in one and only one way as $g = h_1...h_n$, where $h_i$ is in ${\mathcal H}_i$, for $i = 1,...,n$
\end{enumerate}
