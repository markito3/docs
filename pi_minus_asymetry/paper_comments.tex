\section{Abstract}

\begin{itemize}
\item line 10: prefer ``...energy range $8.2 < E_\gamma < 8.8$~GeV."
\item line 12: prefer ``...and compared to theoretical  models."
\item line 17: ``Constraining production mechanisms...study of unconventional mesons." A statement more appropriate in the introduction and conclusions, perhaps not for the abstract. Is there another physics conclusion that should be emphasized here?
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item lines 20-44: Importance for hybrid searches should perhaps be shortened and put at the end of the introduction. It is a forward-looking observation but the not the direct subject of the paper.
\item line 58: prefer ``...of the beam asymmetry $\Sigma$..."
\item line 68: The electron is the incoming beam particle. Recoil does not seem appropriate to describe it. Perhaps ``post-radiative electron" or ``electrons that have radiated a significant amount of energy"
\item line 69: ``tags" needs closing double quotes
\item line 75: prefer ``...travel 75 m from the radiator and pass through..."
\item line 80: remove from ``which utilizes..." through ``..quantum electrodynamics" including the equation. Unnecessary detail, and explained in the reference.
\item line 84: prefer ``...with values of up to 40\%". Maximum value implies some sort of limit to my ear.
\item line 94: prefer ``...two drift chamber systems". Just ``two drift chambers" could mean just two drift chambers.
\item line 96: prefer ``...arranged in stereo and axial layers,..."
\item line 97: prefer ``...at large polar angles and...". ``Larger" leads to the question: larger than what?
\item line 98: prefer ``energy loss (dE/dx)". Without the parenthesis, it does not scan.
\item line 99: prefer ``Each FDC plane consists of anode wire and cathode strips, both of which are read-out". Internally we call ``package" the set of six planes. ``Readout" applies to the anodes as well but as written could imply only cathodes are readout.
\item line 105:  prefer replacement  of ``consists of" with ``is done with" 
\item line 107: prefer replacement of ``immediately surrounds" with ``is located just outside"
\end{itemize}
