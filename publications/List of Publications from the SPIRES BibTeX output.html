<h2>Preparing the LaTeX List of Publications from the SPIRES BibTeX
output</h2>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

[1] copy the Spires output with the list of your articles in the BibTeX format to
a file called, <i>e.g.,</i> spires.bib. (Delete a header and possible
html markup at the top and bottom).<p>

[2] choose from a variety of  <b>bst</b> files from 
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/hep/bibstyles.html">here</a>.
You can use many other BibTeX style files, but the one listed above will
handle correctly the 
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/hep/latex.html">citation</a>
and eprint fields in the Spires output.</p><p>

[3] prepare a simple file called, <i>e.g.,</i> mywork.tex. It should have the
following form:
</p><pre> 
\documentclass[12pt]{article}   %or use your favorite doc class
\renewcommand\refname{My Wonderful Publications}       %change as needed
\providecommand{\href}[2]{#2}   %generates the href macro if needed
\begin{document}
   \nocite{*}                   %this uses *everything* in the .bib file
   \bibliography{spires}        %or whatever your .bib file is
   \bibliographystyle{utphys}   %if you use utphys.bst
\end{document}   

</pre>

[4] to process the file, use several "latex" and "bibtex" commands. 
Particularly, for the file named mywork.tex (above), do the following:
<pre>
latex mywork
bibtex mywork
latex mywork             (twice!)
latex mywork

</pre>
 
[5] if everything worked well, you now have the mywork.dvi file that you
can send to a printer or turn into a postscript file. Check and see
what changes have to be done to the original .bib file (some titles and
author names will likely have to be changed from the Spires ascii form to
the real TeX markup). Redo step [4] if needed.<p>

Acknowledgment: The instructions are based on Jacques Distler's
suggestion. We are grateful for his interest and help! If you can refine the
procedure (while still keeping it simple), please
